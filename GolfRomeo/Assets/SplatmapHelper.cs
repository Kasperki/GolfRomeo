*
*	Use at your own risk. No warranty (expressed or implied). You're on your own if this results in the loss of data, the death of all mankind, or anything in between.
*
*	Quick Instructions:
*
*		MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A RECENT BACKUP!!!!
*
*		This must be placed in an editor folder (like your Assets/Editor folder)!
*		A few menu options will appear in the Unity3D Editor under "Terrain/SplatmapHelper".
*
*		TOOL #1 - Converts splatmap->PNG
*					-Select the Unity Terrain Splatmap from your asset folder (often a child of an asset called something like "New Terrain 1.asset")
*					-Run the tool. Read the warnings.
*					-It will ask you for a location for the new PNG. If overwriting an old PNG, you may need the read/write flag enabled int it's texture first.
*					-Note that your new PNG will lack the alpha channel.
*
*		TOOL #2 - Converts a PNG to splatmap "format"
*					-This is required to restore the alpha channel.
*					-Select the PNG you've worked on/adjusted.
*					-Run the tool. Read the warnings.
*					-It will ask you for a location for the splatmap-ready PNG. If overwriting an old one (or the current one), you may need to set read/write.
*
*		TOOL #3 - Puts a "splatmap ready" PNG into a Unity Terrain's splatmap (overwriting it).
*					-Make sure you've run tool#2 first if you've done any editing (otherwise it will probably show up all white).
*					-Select the splatmap (just like in #1).
*					-Run the tool. Read the warnings.
*					-It will ask you for the location of the splatmap-ready PNG you created in #2.
*					-NOTE THAT THE FILE BROWSER MAY SHOW IT AS TRANSPARANT. DON'T PANIC. You can verify it looks "right" from within Unity if you want
*					 (browsing to it from the assets folder in Unity, it will usually show the Red/Green/Blue correct).
*
*	Credit/thanks to:
*		-Kragh of the Unity3D forum for posting some C# code that handles the transparancy issue in a nifty way ( http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/encode-to-png.214663/#post-1439634 ).
*		-VivienS for a UnityAnswers comment that aided in putting this together as well ( http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/13479/exporting-terrain-splatmap.html ).
*		-The many others who ask/answer questions on the Unity forums on a regular basis.

Note that it can easily destroy your terrain's splatmap if something goes wrong, so BACK UP your project first.\n\nTool #1 - Select your splatmap from your assets folder (a child under what usually looks like 'New Terrain 1.asset'), and it will ask you for a location in which to make a new PNG.\n\nTool #2 - Select a PNG you have worked on, and this will convert it to a splatmap-friendly format.\n\nTool #3 - Select your splatmap (similar to #1), and it will ask you for a PNG (that you probably ran through #2) to copy over your splatmap.\n\nCaveats are shown on the next page, but more info can be found at http://mattgadient.com/2014/09/28/unity3d-a-free-script-to-convert-a-splatmap-to-a-png/", "Next");
        EditorUtility.DisplayDialog("The gist... (2/2)", "There are some caveats to watch for, because a splatmap puts the 4 texture strengths in the 4 color channels (1 each in R,G,B,A).\n\n1) Most image editors don't like this, so this tool (TOOL #1) sets that 'A' channel to full. While this basically destroys any splat info about your 4th texture, it makes it possible to work on and edit the first 3 channels of the PNG or otherwise cut/rotate/edit/modify the thing. When you're done editing the PNG, TOOL #2 will try to recalculate the 'A' channel based on what R,G,B are (normally they should add up to 1.0).\n\n2) Due to the above, after you've finished with the PNG and run #2 to get the transparancy added again, the image MAY LOOK TRANSPARANT in your file browser (so don't panic on step #3 when you browse for the file and see it's transparant).\n\n3) During TOOL #3, you may need to set the READ/WRITE flag for the PNG texture so that it can read from it. This is done by selecting the PNG, choosing 'Advanced' for the texture type, and enabling the flag. If you choose to overwrite any previous files in #1 or #2, you may need to do so as well.\n\nMore info at http://mattgadient.com/2014/09/28/unity3d-a-free-script-to-convert-a-splatmap-to-a-png/", "OK");
